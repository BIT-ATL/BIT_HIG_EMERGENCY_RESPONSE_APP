# A Note on Advertising
Advertisements (ads for short) are an expected element in most communication domains. However, the expectation of an ad does not mean we have to present stale and/or lazy content. 

## New Alias
The point of refinement? Change the alias. Ads are now "in-application communications (or in-app comms)", transitioning the ad beyond its sell-only limitations.

## What's So New About this New Ad?
In-app comms done in this new vein — attempting to communicate beyond serving the advertiser's bottom line — yield more communicative freedom. 

The communication also needs to express energy, speak to an intuition, be well designed, feel native to the the platform, and include two-way interactivity; meaning the communication offers more than an options to buy some product or service.

# Any References?
One company that has done an excellent job transforming the state of ads? WeTransfer. They reduced the “advertisement-ness” and leaned into visual communication as an opportunity for the audience (key consumer) to explore, become intrigued. 

# Optimistic Assumption
People want inspiration and guidance at all levels, even in their advertisements. We have an opportunity to deliver this :)
